# Udagram

This is the Udacity Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udagram project (Project 2).

The repo contains scripts to create resources for deploying an instagram clone (Udagram).

To use this repo, ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and in your PATH (MacOS and Linux) then run the script **create.sh** along with the arguments `stack-name`, and the paths to the `template file` and `parameter file` e.g

```
./create.sh my-sample-stack /path/to/template /path/to/parameter
```
